<h2 class="title">About:</h2>
<p>Hello there. My GitHub username is sergeirocks100, and you are currently viewing my website.</p>
<p>I am relatively familiar with BYOND, and i have been contributing on-and-off to /tg/station and Skyrat for about 3 years, in addition to running my own codebase, called GearStation.</p>
<p>I also recently became involved with Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead, and i made my first pull request there in June of this year.</p>
<h2 class="title">Projects:</h2>
<p><img src="images/gearlogo.png" style="width: 100px; height: 100px;"><b> GearStation:</b></p>
<p><a href="https://gearstation.tk/index.html">GearStation</a> is an SS13 codebase that i run.</p>
<p>I first forked GearStation from /tg/ in June of 2021, because i wasn't happy with the creative direction that /tg/ was going in, and i wanted to do something different.</p>
<p>Even though GearStation's player count has never entered the double digits, and i had to rebase the code at the end of last year because of compatibility concerns with BYOND 515, it has been running strong for over 2 years, and i hope i can keep it running for many years to come.</p>
<p><img src="images/dmlogo.png" style="width: 100px; height: 100px;"><b> Death March:</b></p>
<p><a href="https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/125659-death-march-a-fps-i-made-in-7-days-v2-update-released">Death March</a> is a FPS game that i developed in the GZDoom engine.</p>
<p>I created the original version of the game in 7 days, after being inspired by Nash Muhandes' ElderJam.</p>
<p>While i've been a little too preoccupied with other things to work on it, which is why it hasn't been updated since May of last year, i do want to continue work on it when i'm in a better situation to do so.</p>
<h2 class="title">Contact:</h2>
